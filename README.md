# Woman on the spectrum

https://elysiaw.github.io/Woman-on-the-spectrum/

This is a project built for the Katy Youth Hacks Hackathon in August 2022.

Sexism is a huge problem in the autistic community, with 20% of girls being diagnosed before 11, compared to 50% of boys. Much less research is carried out into Autism in females and male-criteria is still used for the diagnosis. Furthermore, autistic women with social struggles are often dismissed as shy. So many autistic women end up late-diagnosed, often feeling quite abandoned.

My website is designed to be a one-stop-shop for autistic women to learn more about Autism.
It is tailored for them, free of male bias and does not only focus on children.
It links them to support networks, teaches self-regulating and educates them on misconceptions in the autistic community.
